## ‚ùì How to use
Most users should simply [invite mStats with this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1045365024425775114&permissions=313344&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

If you're an advanced user and want to self-host, create a file named `config.json` in the root directory of the project. Paste the contents of the `config.template.json` file into the file, obviously replacing the placeholders with their values from the Discord developer dashboard.

Run `npm start` to start the bot.
Have fun :-)
